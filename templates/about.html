    Campus Connect is a student-built platform designed to make campus life feel smaller,
    friendlier, and easier to navigate. It brings tutoring, events, groups, messaging, and
    skill-sharing into one place so students can find what they need without digging through
    endless group chats or flyers.

    <h2>What Students Are Saying</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        “I used Campus Connect to find a data structures tutor the week before midterms.
        We matched by subject and availability in minutes, and it made a huge difference
        in my final grade.”
        <br><strong>— Jordan, Computer Science Major</strong>
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        “It’s so much easier to keep track of study jams and club events now. Instead of
        juggling flyers and random chats, I just check the events section and RSVP there.”
        <br><strong>— Maya, Biology Major</strong>
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        “I offered Spanish practice through the skill exchange and found someone who helped
        me with resume writing in return. It feels like a real peer-to-peer support system,
        not just another app.”
        <br><strong>— Luis, Modern Languages & Business</strong>

    <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
    <p>
      Campus Connect started from a simple question: why is it so hard to find the right
      people and resources when they’re already on the same campus? We saw classmates
      struggling to locate tutors, events with open seats that students never heard about,
      and groups that wanted more members but didn’t have a central place to reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project was created to address that gap by combining profiles, tutoring, events,
      groups, messaging, and maps into a single experience built from a student perspective.
      It is currently a GUI-only prototype built to satisfy the Campus Connect course rubric:
      backend features like password hashing, email delivery, and push notifications are
      represented through UI placeholders, alerts, and localStorage simulations rather than
      a live production server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as a prototype, the design aims to show how a real version of Campus Connect
      could make it easier for students to succeed academically, meet people they might not
      otherwise cross paths with, and feel more at home on campus.
