    <p class="guideline-intro">
      Campus Connect is built to help students learn, collaborate, and connect.
      To keep everyone safe and supported, please follow these core expectations:
    </p>

    <ul class="guideline-list">
      <li>
        <h3>Be respectful & professional</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Use clear, courteous language in messages and posts. Treat classmates,
          tutors, and organizers the way you’d want to be treated.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <br>
        <h3>No spam, harassment, or discrimination</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Do not send repeated unwanted messages, advertise irrelevant services,
          or target anyone based on identity, background, or beliefs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <br>
        <h3>Be honest about your skills & availability</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Accurately represent your experience, rates, and schedule so other
          students can rely on the information you share.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <br>
        <h3>Keep conversations on-topic & safe</h3>
        <p class="muted">
          Use Campus Connect for academic, professional, and campus-related
          networking. Report anything that feels unsafe, threatening, or
          clearly outside these goals.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
